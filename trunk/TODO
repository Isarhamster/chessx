3) Ideas/Suggestions. Non critical
   * Ideas for database switching. 
      - Database window like Scid
      - Dockable toolbar with a tool button for each database (My favourite idea)
      - Tab bar with a tab for each database
   * Format for electronic books
   * Format for exercises, tactics/endgmae training etc.
