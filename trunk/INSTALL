1. Requirements
  
To compile ChessX, you need Qt version 4.8, better is Qt 5.3 or above.
Reported issue: FICS does not work properly with Qt4

2. Compilation

Compiling the source is simple. Execute:
  qmake
and then
  make

If the compilation is successful you should be able to run ChessX
executable in bin subdirectory. It is called: chessx on Linux,
chessx.app on Mac OS, chessx.exe on Windows

3. Problems

You may check your Qt version by running:
  qmake -v

If you erroneously tried to build with Qt3, be sure to recreate
makefiles using:
  qmake -recursive

If your compiler does not support C++11, comment out CONFIG += c++11, see file chessx.pro
If your Qt libraries are compiled w/o Multimedia, comment out CONFIG += sound, see file chessx.pro
Depending on your installed libraries, you may have to experiment with
# DEFINES += ZLIB_WINAPI
# LIBS += -lz
# INCLUDEPATH += <path to qt>/QtZlib

4. Debugging

If you want to help debugging ChessX, rebuild with debug option enabled:
  qmake -recursive -after "CONFIG+=debug"
  make
