1. Requirements
  
To compile ChessX, you need Qt version 4.2.0 or above.


2. Compilation

Compiling the source is simple. Execute:
  qmake
and then
  make

If the compilation is successful you should be able to run ChessX
executable in bin subdirectory. It is called: chessx on Linux,
chessx.app on Mac OS, chessx.exe on Windows


3. Problems

If you have both Qt3 and Qt4 installed, verify that Qt4 is first
on your path. You may check it, running:
  qmake -v

If you erroneously tried to build with Qt3, be sure to recreate
makefiles using:
  qmake -recursive
  

4. Debugging

If you want to help debugging ChessX, rebuild with debug option enabled:
  qmake -recursive -after "CONFIG+=debug"
  make
