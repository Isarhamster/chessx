 <h3>Opening a database</h3>
 <p>You can open a database either from the File menu or drag a file from Explorer / Finder into the Databases view.</p>
 <p>You can make a database stay permanently in the database list by turning it into a "Favorite" (right-click the file).
 A database is reopened from there by clicking the asterisk or again by the context menu.</p>

 <h3>Making moves</h3>
 <p>A move is done by gabbing a piece and dragging it
 to another square.</p>
 <p>Depending on your settings in the board preferences,
 you can either
 <ul>
  <li>Click on a piece and a target square (if move guesses are deactivated)
  <li>Click on a piece and accepting the move quess (in case of deactivated next guess on right click)
  <li>Right Click on a piece and then again until the correct target square is high-lighted, then press the
  left mouse button to make the move (in case right click is used for next guess).
 </ul>
 </p>
 <p>Going back a move can be done by a right-click (in case the right click is not configured for backtracking a move)
 or by pressing CTRL-right click if backtracking is assigned to the right mouse key.</p>

 <p>Usually, making a move will insert a new variation unless you are at the end of the game or a variation. If you do not
want to create a new variation, press CTRL+SHIFT while moving, which replaces the current move by the new move.</p>

<h3>Annotating moves</h3>
<p>Move annotations can be done by activating the context menu in the games text browser or by simply pressing the corresponding key sequence,
e.g. '!?','!!','??','!x','?x','=','+-','-+' and so on, where 'x' is used in case the first character is ambiguous, 'x' can be the
Return/Enter-Key or literally the small letter 'x'.</p>

<h3>Saving games</h3>
<p>Saving games is slightly confusing! A game needs to be saved into the database (Press CTRL+S, Menu Game/Save). From there,
the whole database needs to be saved to disk by pressing CTRL+Shift+S / Menu File/Save. This is somewhat inconvenient but on the other hand prevents
you from mistakenly overwriting games or files.</p>
<p>By default, a clipboard database is open, which does not have a backing file on disk. Anything that remains in the Clipboard is
lost upon closing ChessX! So you need to open at least one other database for writing and transfer anything from the Clipboard
into this database by either dragging the games to that database or using "Copy Games" from the Database menu.</p>

<h3>Switching databases</h3>
<p>Switching between open databases can be achieved by either the Database menu, pressing CTRL+Number 0 .. 9 or clicking onto the asterisk
in the database list. The currently selected database is also highlighted there!</p>

<h3>Analysing games</h3>
<p>There are two analysis windows where two different engines can be configured to analyse the current board position.</p>
<p>Engines must be configured before in the Preferences Dialog. A default engine (Stockfish) comes with this installation
and will be configured as first engine, if no other entries exist.
Stockfish is an open source engine (see <a href="http://stockfishchess.org">Homepage of Stockfish</a>. The Mac OS
version has been compiled less agressively than the original one so that users of pre-I5 Intel computers will have their fun, too.
The source code for the Stockfish engine is completely unmodified so you can replace the pre-installed versions by the original
or any other version. The source code for stockfish is also located on the homepage. Note that Sotckfish is licensed under GPLv3,
see the license text on the Stockfish home.</p>
<p>You can fine-tune engines with the protocol options dialog (works for UCI only, Winboard is seldom used and due to the clumsy specification
hard to implement for GUI developers.</p>

<h3>Generating content</h3>
<p>You can copy/paste positions(FEN and images) and complete games(PGN) from/into the clipboard, export games in LATEX, HTML or PGN again.
See the Edit menu and the File/Export Dialog.</p>

<h3>Customizing Listviews</h3>
<p>All views can have their font-size set in the Preferences Dialog. In addtion, all list header support resizing,
moving and hiding of columns. Columns are hidden / shown by right-clicking the list header element. All changes are persistent.</p>

<h3>Filtering Games</h3>
<p>The list of games can be filtered either by the opening tree or by clicking the list header. Several searches can be combined or inverted.
Further occurrences of the current board position in the current database can be found via the Find / Find Position menu.</p>
