<h3><a name="ChessX on a stick"></a>ChessX on a Stick</h3>
<p>You can save a copy of your settings to the application folder (instead of the systems storage for ini files)
from the App pane of the Preferences dialog. Upon restart, ChessX will look into the application folder
for a ini file and will use this one instead of the system location. This can be useful when putting ChessX on
a stick.</p>
<p>For putting ChessX on a stick simply install ChessX onto a computer, create a copy of the settings as described above
and then copy the complete installation to a memory stick.</p>
<p>Note that the databases themselves will need to be copied separately and paths to them will not work (unless they are
the same on all computers).</p>

<h3><a name="Custom-Arrange"></a>Arranging widgets</h3>
<p>All lists and widgets can be docked at any place or can be grouped together in a tab view.</p>
<p>If a widget is hidden, you can show it by selecting the View Menu from the menu bar.</p>

<h3><a name="Custom-Lists"></a>Customizing Listviews</h3>
<p>All views can have their font-size set in the Preferences Dialog. In addtion, all list header support resizing,
moving and hiding of columns. Columns are hidden / shown by right-clicking the list header element. All changes are persistent.</p>

<h3><a name="Custom-Gamelist"></a>Customizing the game list</h3>
<p>The game list shows the most common PGN tags in its columns. You can add columns by putting PGN tags into the Preference/Appearance/Additional PGN tags,
e.g. "Setup FEN" will add two columns with the tags Setup and FEN respectively.</p>
<p>There is a special tag call "Medal". If this tag is given a color's name, the game's list entry will use this color as background.</p>

<h3><a name="Custom-Board"></a>Customizing Board and Notation</h3>
<p>You can customize board and notation easily in the Preferences Dialog. Especially the notation can be changed to reflect your
local standard. E.g., in Germany, the "Queen" is called "Dame" and thus represented by a "D" rather than a "Q". Change the piece letters
in the Appearance tab of the Preferences. You can also change to a symblic representation of the pieces, provided you
OS supplies the character sets used. That is the case with Mac OS X and Windows 7, untested with Linux. The PGN remains unchanged,
it is defined with KQRBN.</p>

<h3><a name="Custom-KB"></a>Customizing Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts are customized with the corresponding dialog from the Help menu.
Please be careful, there is no checking for syntax errors or invalid entries, yet.</p>
<p>Note that the customization is associated with a language selection so you can have a different
keyboard scheme with different languages.</p>

<h3><a name="Custom-Icons"></a>Customize icons in menus</h3>
<p>Icons in menus can be enabled or disabled in the Preference dialog. Having icons in menus may help to get comforable with
ChessX initially, lateron, you will probably do not want to have them in the menus.</p>

<h3><a name="Themes"></a>Themes and Languages</h3>
<p>ChessX has a built-in dark theme which can be activated via the Settings/Appearance.
You can make the dark theme look better by changing the Settings/Game/Colors/MainLine to White.</p>
<p>Changing the active theme or selecting a different localization requires a restart of ChessX.</p>
