Adding, building and running unit-tests for ChexxS using qtestlib


To add new tests do the following steps:

1. Create a class which contains the unit-test.

You may use the pgndatabasetest.h and pgndatabasetest.cpp as templates.
The important thing is to add the include: #include <QtTest/QtTest>

There are some special private slots:

initTestCase():        this slot is called once when the test is constructed
init():		       this slot is called before each test
cleanup():	       this slot is called after each test
cleanupTestCase():     this slot is called after all tests have been run

2. Add the sourcefiles of your test class to the testrunner.pro

3. Add a test object for your test class to the testrunner
The procedure is straight forward - you may copy the already set up tests
in the testrunner.cpp

4. qmake - to create the Makefile

The GNUmakefile is intended to add default test targets.

5. make - the application testrunner is created

6. make tests - runs the tests, writes the testlog.log and displays the
testresults using more

make testsv - does the same as make tests but puts more verbose output
into the testlog.log

7. Check the log and fix FAILED tests.
