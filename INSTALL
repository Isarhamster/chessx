1. Requirements
  
To compile ChessX, you need Qt version 4.8, better is Qt 5.3 or above.

2. Compilation

Compiling the source is simple. Execute:
  qmake
and then
  make

If the compilation is successful you should be able to run ChessX
executable in bin subdirectory. It is called: chessx on Linux,
chessx.app on Mac OS, chessx.exe on Windows

3. Problems

You may check your Qt version by running:
  qmake -v

If you erroneously tried to build with Qt3, be sure to recreate
makefiles using:
  qmake -recursive
  
4. Debugging

If you want to help debugging ChessX, rebuild with debug option enabled:
  qmake -recursive -after "CONFIG+=debug"
  make
